<h1>Why do we Remember?</h1>
<p>Remembrance Day is a memorial day observed by Canadians and other members of the Commonwealth since the end of the First World War in order to remember all those who fought and died in the line of duty to keep us free.  Every year on November 11, Canadians pause in a moment of silence to honour and remember more than 2 million Canadians who have served, and continue to serve, Canada during times of war, conflict, and peace.  If we do not remember, their sacrifice is meaningless.</p>
